# Berkeley Earth Climate Data Time Series Analysis
Time series prediction using python and scikit learn

## Dependencies

This project uses Python and requires the following packages from pip:
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn

## Preparing the feature sets

Download the data from [Berkeley Earth](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) and extract the "GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv" file into the repository's directory. Then, use `python3 make-feature-sets.py` to export the various different feature set files into a `feature-sets` directory.

## Running the machine learning models

You can then configure and run whichever code you want for each model (i.e. cross-validation, training, evaluation, etc.) in each file. These are generally configured by a string near the top of each model's file.

Here's what each file does:
- `lasso.py` Cross-validates the lasso regression penalty and trains and evaluates a lasso regression model against an "average of features" baseline predictor
- `linear.py` Trains and evaluates a linear regression model against an "average of features" baseline predictor
- `load_feature_sets.py` Contains some useful functions used by the tree models for loading the feature data generated by `make_feature_sets.py`
- `make_feature_sets.py` Reads the entire Berkeley Earth data set and writes each country and city's feature set files into a `feature-sets` directory
- `ridge.py`  Cross-validates the ridge regression penalty and trains and evaluates a ridge regression model against an "average of features" baseline predictor
