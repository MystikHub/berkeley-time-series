# Berkeley Earth Climate Data Time Series Analysis
Time series prediction using python and scikit learn

### Preparing the feature sets

Download the data from [Berkeley earth](https://berkeleyearth.org/)

Use `python3 make-feature-sets.py` to export the various different feature set files. On an i7-9750H this needed around 14GB of memory (with other apps open) and took 1 minute and 18 seconds to process and organize 509MB of data
